    <div id="error" style="opacity: 0;">To reduce the error, I assumed that you were born in the middle of the day (12:00:00.000), so the maximum error is reduced to about 12 hours.<br>
        The largest time range:<br>
        If you were born at the very end of the day (23:59:59.999). But we assume that you were born at 12:00:00.000, then the error will be 12 hours minus 1 millisecond.<br>
        If you were born at the very beginning of the day (00:00:00.000). Similarly, assuming that you were born at 12:00:00.000, then the error will be -12 hours.<br> 
        The smallest time range: If you were born at the exact middle of the day (12:00:00.000), then the smallest error will be 0, because we have accurately assumed your birth time.<br>
        The error of this calculation is 12 hours.</div>
